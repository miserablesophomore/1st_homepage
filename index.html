        <span>After my freshman year, I went to the army and became interested in programming and computer.
            While I was looking for opportunities to learn programming, a company offered me an internship, 
            so I took advantage of it, took a semester off, joined the company. After learning basic concepts of computer (from operating system, compilers to high-level 
            languages, security and encryption), first task for me was front-end web development. 
            While progressing the work, I got to know about server, database and the other parts of service development and how each parts are combined to 
            work smoothly as a whole. <br> <br>
            After I came back to school, I had to use python to solve numerical problems in fluid mechanics (Numpy, Scipy) <br>
            During summer vacation, I took introductory course of Graduate School of Data Science, deepening the understanding of this field.

            Bitcoin is <i>definitely</i> a big issue. Some people say it is disgusting and some people say it is revolution. Either way, this is new technology 
            that needs time to be matured <br>
            After Satoshi Nakamoto first uploaded his first <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">paper</a> about bitcoin, suggesting peer-to-peer electronic cash system in 2008, 
            it has become a syndrome. <br>
            Besides the speculative investment, I am truely interested in the technological implication. <br>
