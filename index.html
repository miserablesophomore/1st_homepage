        <span>After my freshman year, I went to the army and became interested in programming and computers.
            While I was looking for opportunities to learn programming, a company offered me an internship, 
            so I took advantage of it, withdrew from school temporarily, to gain company experience. I learned basic concepts of computer and 
            programming (from operating system, compilers to high-level languages, security and encryption). My first task was front-end web 
            development. While progressing the work, I got to know about server, database and all the other parts of service and how each parts are well-combined to 
            work smoothly as a whole. <br> <br>
            After I came back to school, I had to use python to solve numerical problems in fluid mechanics (Numpy, Scipy) <br>
            During summer vacation, I took introductory course of Graduate School of Data Science, deepening the understanding of this field.

            Bitcoin is <i>definitely</i> a big issue. Some people say it is disgusting and some people say it is revolution. Either way, this is new technology 
            that should be matured
