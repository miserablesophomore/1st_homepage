        <span>After my freshman year, I went to the army and became interested in programming and computer.
            While I was looking for opportunities, a company offered me an internship, so I joined the company. 
            After learning basic concepts of computer (from operating system, compilers to high-level 
            languages, security and encryption), I jumped into front-end web development. 
            While progressing the work, I got to know about server, database and the other parts of service development and how each parts are combined to 
            work smoothly as a whole. <br> <br>
            After I came back to school, I learned python to solve numerical problems in fluid mechanics (Numpy, Scipy) <br>
            During summer vacation, I took introductory course of Graduate School of Data Science, deepening the understanding of this field. 
            <br><br>
            I am paying attention to the development of blockchain technology including cryptocurrency and decentralized application.
            Besides the speculative investment, I am truely interested in its technological influence. <br>
