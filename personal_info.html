        <p>"젊은이들이 요즘 세상을 바라보면 세상이나 자기 삶에 대한 생각이 아마 이해할 수 없는 미스터리 같은 것이 아닐까, <br>
            그런 의도로 만들어진 영화라고 말할 수 있겠습니다"

        <p>“Its just money; its <b>made up</b>. Pieces of paper with pictures on it so we don’t have to kill each other
            just to get something to eat.
            It’s not wrong. And it’s certainly no different today than its ever been. 1637, 1797, 1819, 37, 57, 84,
            1901, 07, 29, 1937, 1974, 1987 —
            Jesus, didn’t that fuck up me up good — 92, 97, 2000 and whatever we want to call this [2008]. <br> <br>

            It’s all just the same thing over and over; we can’t help ourselves. And you and I can’t control it, or stop
            it, or even slow it.
            Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right.
            And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. <br> <br>

            And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. <i>Happy
                foxes and sad sacks.
                Fat cats and starving dogs in this world.</i> Yeah, there may be more of us today than there’s ever
            been. But the <b>percentages</b>-they stay exactly the same.”

        <span>A Tale of Two Cities (1859)</span>
        <p>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of
            foolishness,
            it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season
            of Darkness,
            it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before
            us, we were
            all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way..."

        <p>
            최고의 시절이자 최악의 시절, 지혜의 시대이자 어리석음의 시대였다. 믿음의 세기이자 의심의 세기였으며, 빛의 계절이자 어둠의 계절이었다. 희망의 봄이면서 곧 절망의 겨울이었다.
            우리 앞에는 모든 것이 있었지만 한편으로 아무것도 없었다. 우리는 모두 천국으로 향해 가고자 했지만 우리는 엉뚱한 방향으로 걸었다.
            말하자면, 지금과 너무 흡사하게, 그 시절 목청 큰 권위자들 역시 좋든 나쁘든 간에 오직 극단적인 비교로만 그 시대를 규정하려고 했다.
